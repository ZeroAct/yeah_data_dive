    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use data and how can we analyze data with python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial deals with various data types, but focuses on `Image` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, different from other tutorials, it uses `Pytorch` deep learning framework for diving into data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Whom?\n",
    "This tutorial is for those who want to understand data in deep learning, escpecially image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires basic knowledge of python and deep learning."
